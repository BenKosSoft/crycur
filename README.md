# Implementing Cryptocurrency with Block Chains

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In cryptocurrency systems, miners approve transactions by running the proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm

## Getting Started

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This program is written in Python 2.7, **Windows 10**. All code should be run with Python 2.7. 
Program creates chain of transactions and prints them into file called "LongestChain.txt".

    $ python blockchaining.py

## Algorithm & Implementation

In this section, we introduce how the program works and constants.

For hashing purpose, SHA3 - 256 has been used.

Each transaction consists some numbers that are randomly generated by the algorithm.
Serial number of transactions are 128-bit uniformly random number.
Payee is randomized 10 character string.
Satoshi Amount is randomized between 10 and 500.
Nonce is also 128-bit uniformly random integer.
Proof of Work is the hash value of the previous lines, 
and nonce is generated randomly until first 6 characters of PoW is 0.
